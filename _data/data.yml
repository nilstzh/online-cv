career-profile:
    title: Summary
    summary: |
      I have 5+ years of experience in web development and looking for an interesting 
      project and a nice team to join. I began my career as a Ruby Backend developer 
      and gained a lot of different experiences since. I’m very much open to exploring 
      new technologies and approaches. I don’t believe “because I’ve always done it this 
      way” to be a valid argument in tech. But I do believe in following best coding 
      practices no matter the stack. 
      I like working in startups because I value flexibility and opportunity to make 
      a bigger impact. Building a cool product with a great team is one of the best parts 
      of being a software engineer for me. 
      I have spent the last four years working on complex VoIP systems but recently 
      feel up for new challenges.
