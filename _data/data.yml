# career-profile:
#     title: Summary
#     summary: |
#       I have 5+ years of experience in web development and looking for an interesting project 
#       and a nice team to join.
#       I don’t believe “because I’ve always done it this way” to be a valid argument in tech. 
#       I keep learning and being curious.
#       One of the best parts of being a software engineer for me is building a cool product 
#       with a great team. 
#       What I’ve been doing so far:
#       - working withing object-oriented and function programming approaches,
#       - building highly concurrent web applications with Elixir and Ruby,
#       - creating systems around event sourcing design pattern,
#       - utilizing event-driven architecture,
#       - implementing APIs and using APIs implemented by others,
#       - keeping high test coverage,
#       - writing code meant to be read,
#       - overthinking how to name a module, class or function.
